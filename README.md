### 3D Gasket Animation - TV Ident
This project is an extended version of the 3D Gasket program from Angel's Interactive Computer Graphics textbook (7th Edition, Section 2.10.10). The program has been transformed into an animated TV Ident—a dynamic, branded logo for a TV channel—while implementing additional functionalities and interactivity.

### Features
**1. TV Ident Animation:**
Rotates the 3D gasket 180° to the right and back, then 180° to the left and back.
Gradually enlarges the gasket to an appropriate size.
Includes continuous movement of the gasket until a button is pressed and other additional animation.

**2. Interactive User Interface:**
Parameters for customization (e.g., number of subdivisions, animation speed, and colors).
Includes buttons, menus, sliders, and event handling (keydown and window events).

**3. Extensible Design:**
Structured, modular codebase following good programming practices.
Additional functionality to enhance user experience and customization.
